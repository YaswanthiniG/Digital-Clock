# Digital-Clock
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock. We can say Digital clock is more accurate when compared to Analog clock. I hope you like this Digital clock and let me know your comments. Thanks!
